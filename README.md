# graph-neural-network

Simple project to teach myself about graph neural networks. 
The dataset used in this project is the Twitch Ego Nets from SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project).
This project uses DeepFindr's YouTube tutorial for reference a lot. (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV8yxwGOxvvoNkzPfCx2i8an--Tkt7O8Z&si=CkgbqaXIGSIhOR35)
